<h1>learning Scheme using chicken implementation</h1>
<p>here I'll keep the notes I make while learning to program in Scheme using
the <a href="https://wiki.call-cc.org/">chicken</a> impl. These are for personal use, so if you stumble
on this by any chance excuse the mistakes and messiness.</p>
<h2>day 1</h2>
<h3>backstory</h3>
<p>I was "watching" a movie while scrolling through my phone checking hacker news
when I stumbled into <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31782985">this post</a> that talked about a <em>hobby</em> programming
lang with a syntax similar to lisp. I never learnt lisp in university and I had
not taken the time to learn more about it, but I was curious on how it worked.
Scrolling through the post comments, I found one that said it was just a Scheme
implementation.</p>
<p>Me, not knowing what they were talking about -- like, what is Scheme? -- decided
to google it to discover that is like lisp but more simple and minimal? (do not
quote me on that)</p>
<p>I started looking for resources to learn this Scheme programming lang. I
found a book called <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/little-schemer-fourth-edition">the little schemer</a>. After reading some reviews
I realised I was not going to learn lisp or scheme with this book alone, but
that this book teaches you how to think in a way that makes you a better lisp
or scheme programmer. I started reading it, but soon realised I wanted to
run some Scheme code first and then come back to this book to improve on my
thinking.</p>
<p>This is where I stumbled with this <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/ftp/garbage/cs345/schintro-v14/schintro_toc.html">book</a>, it seems it's like for
a computer science class in the University of Texas? I don't know. Anyway, I
read the overview, and jumped into the <em>using scheme</em> part.</p>
<p>First thing it mentioned is that you'll need a scheme implementation to follow
this book. I did not have any installed in my OpenBSD workstation. So I went
surfing the web looking for different options. After a quick search I soon
realised that there are a lot, but there were two that caught my attention
<a href="https://wiki.call-cc.org/">chicken</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/">guile</a>. I choose the first one, installed it
in my system with <code>pkg_add chicken</code> (simple as that) and I was able to jump
into a interactive programming enviorment (the same thing as if you type
python in your terminal, like a shell) by typing <code>chicken-csi</code>, and then
the fun started :).</p>
<h3>actual notes</h3>
<h4>define things</h4>
<p>you can do <code>chicken-csi</code> to start an interactive programming env. There you can
define variables and things like that. From what I've learned, there are
two main things in schemes, atoms and lists.</p>
<ul>
<li>hola is an atom</li>
<li>(hola jose) is a list</li>
</ul>
<p>To define a variable, you can do:</p>
<pre><code>#;&gt; (define number 10)
#;&gt; number
10
</code></pre>
<p>then if you type <code>number</code> it will show the 10.
(I will just write <code>#;&gt;</code> to symbolise the prompt.)</p>
<p>This is the way you define procedures too (I'm pretty sure a procedure is the
same as a function, but with diff name). Here's an example:</p>
<pre><code>#;&gt; (define (double n)
        (+ n n))
</code></pre>
<p>We are defining a procedure with the name <code>double</code> that receives 1 param <code>n</code>
then it adds <code>n + n</code> and returns it. Note that the operation is not in the way
we usually think of operations, instead the operator <strong>precede</strong> the operands.</p>
<p>Once I saw the notation I remember our Discrete Maths class, we saw this type
of notation, it is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation">polish notation</a> and help us when you want
to build trees out of the operations. Anyway, back to chicken scheme.</p>
<h4>booleans</h4>
<p>we can write an if statement very easily.</p>
<pre><code>(if (&lt; 1 2)
    1
    2)
</code></pre>
<p>This is read as, if 1 is less than 2 return 1 else return 2, in python it
would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>if 1 &lt; 2:
    return 1
return 2
</code></pre>
<p>there are special objects that represent true <code>#t</code> and false <code>#f</code> so if you
do:</p>
<pre><code>#;&gt; (&lt; 2 3)
#t
</code></pre>
<p>You can see that it returns the true object.</p>
<p>Finally, let's see a procedure that uses an if statement.</p>
<pre><code>(define (min_n a b)
    (if (&lt; a b)
        a
        b))
</code></pre>
<p>now we can call it just by doing</p>
<pre><code>#;&gt; (min_n 10 2)
2
</code></pre>
<p><em>NOTE</em>: any other value other than <code>#f</code> is considered true</p>
<p>I decided to stop there for the first day, hopefully I have time to continue
on learning Scheme in the next few days, I'm enjoying it quite a bit.</p>
<h2>day 2</h2>
<p>to be continued... (hopefully soon)</p>

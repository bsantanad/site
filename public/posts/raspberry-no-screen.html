<h1>Set up wifi in raspberry os (no monitor, no keyboard, no mouse)</h1>
<h2>what we'll do</h2>
<p><strong>ethernet cable needed</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>flash image into microsd</li>
<li>enable sshd before boot</li>
<li>conect raspberry to router</li>
<li>connect via ssh</li>
<li>set up wifi</li>
</ol>
<p><em>disclamer: I don't know if this is the best way of doing this, but
it works :)</em></p>
<h2>flash image to microsd</h2>
<p>already discussed this in another <a href="https://bsantanad.com/posts/flash-img.html">post</a></p>
<h2>enable the ssh daemon before first boot</h2>
<p>The raspberry OS doesn't enable ssh by default. So we need to enable it,
we could enable it in our first boot, but since we don't have a screen
how would we enable the option.</p>
<p>All we need to do is the following:
After we flashed the image to the microsd, two partitions will be created
<em>boot</em> and <em>roofts</em>, if I'm not mistaken. We need to mount the <em>boot</em>
partition and add a file in there, this can be done by just:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">touch ssh
</code></pre>
<p>by just creating a file named <strong>ssh</strong> in the boot partition, raspberry os,
will enable sshd.</p>
<p>if you don't know how to mount a device check</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">man mount
</code></pre>
<p>for more info</p>
<h2>connect to router</h2>
<p>Okay, get up from your chair and go to your router. Connect the ethernet
cable to both the raspberry pi and your router, hear the click in both
sides and plug the raspberry into the power socket.</p>
<p>Depending on the model, you'll see some lights turning on and off,
this is normal don't worry, if nothing turns on, then you didn't connected
the raspberry into the wall or your charger is broken or something :(</p>
<h2>connect via ssh</h2>
<p>Okay, so now we know that the raspberry has access to your local
network but we don't know its IP address. There are a couple
ways you can do this but the easiest and simplest is to do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ifconfig -a
</code></pre>
<p>find your IP address, is something like: 192.168.bla1.bla2, once you find it
then we use a tool called nmap, to check for devices in our local network</p>
<p>if nmap it's not installed you can do</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo dnf install nmap
</code></pre>
<p>or use <em>apt</em>, if you are in debian</p>
<p>Now, we did the ifconfig for two reasons, first, to know our IP address, and
second to see the <strong>bla1</strong> number (192.168.bla1.bla2).
The raspberry probably is in the same bla1 number as your computer.</p>
<p>(Please note that <strong>bla1</strong> isn't the official term :) )</p>
<p>Well, let's do it, let's use nmap</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">nmap -F 192.168.&lt;bla1&gt;.1-255
</code></pre>
<p>replace <strong>bla1</strong> with your number :)</p>
<p>All the devices in your local network will show up. If you see a lot of them
with the port <strong>22</strong> open, then unplug your raspberry, run the command,
plug it, wait a few seconds, and run the command again. See what device showed
up when you plugged the raspberry. Most likely this is your raspberry.</p>
<p>In case you only see your computer and other device with the port <strong>22</strong> open
then probably that's your raspberry. If not, do the "unplug" thing I mentioned</p>
<p>Now all we have to do is</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ssh pi@192.168.&lt;bla1&gt;.&lt;bla2&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>the IP address is the one you took from the <em>nmap</em> command.</p>
<p>It will ask you something about a key, say <strong>yes</strong>, and then it will
ask you a password. Remeber the password we set in the first step? just
kidding lol. The default password is <strong>raspberry</strong>. Write it down, and
if you see</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">pi@raspberrypi:~ $
</code></pre>
<p>Hurray :) you're in.</p>
<h2>set up wifi</h2>
<p>I'd recommend changing the password with</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">passwd
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can run</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo raspi-config
</code></pre>
<p>A GUI will be opened, select <strong>System Options</strong>, and then <strong>Wireless LAN</strong>
write your SSID and passphrase.
Select <strong>finish</strong></p>
<h2>check everything right</h2>
<p>Finally, just run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ifconfig -a
</code></pre>
<p>You must see the wlan0 interface with an IP address. If that's there:
congrats! Now you can unplug the ethernet cable, your raspberry has
wifi now.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Probably not, but the IP from wlan0 can change, take your
precautions. But don't worry you can always use <em>nmap</em> to find it.</p>
<p>Hope that helps,</p>
<p>happy coding :)</p>
